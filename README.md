## Loan Calc

#### Loan Calc is the second in the series of Vanilla JS excercise projects.

#### It is a loan calculator web application where the user can enter the loan amount, the interest, and the years to repay. The output is showing the user the relevant information. The main focus here is excercising DOM manipulation by using events, math calculation, displaying flash error messages, and using delay JS methods for a better user experience.

#### Loan Calc uses the Bootstrap CSS library.
